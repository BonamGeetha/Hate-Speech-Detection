Hate Speech Detection Project

Project Overview
This repository contains code and resources for detecting hate speech in text data. The primary goal is to build a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying and classifying text content that promotes or incites hatred, discrimination, or violence.
Key Features
 * Data Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning, normalizing, and tokenizing text data to prepare it for modeling.
 * Feature Engineering: Methods for extracting relevant features from the preprocessed text, such as n-grams, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.
 * Model Selection and Training: Experimentation with various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Deep Learning) and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
 * Evaluation Metrics: Calculation of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess model effectiveness.
 * Deployment: Potential strategies for deploying the trained model into real-world applications.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository:
   git clone : https://github.com/BonamGeetha/Hate-Speech-Detection.git
    * Install Dependencies:
   Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed. Use a requirements file (if provided) or install manually:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

 * Prepare Data:
   Download or create a dataset containing text examples with corresponding hate speech labels. Place the data in a suitable directory.
 * Run Preprocessing:
   Execute the preprocessing scripts to clean, normalize, and tokenize the text data.
 * Feature Engineering:
   Apply feature extraction techniques to create numerical representations of the text.
 * Model Training:
   Train the selected machine learning models on the preprocessed data.
 * Evaluation:
   Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics.
 * Deployment (Optional):
   Consider deploying the best-performing model into a web application, API, or other real-world context.
